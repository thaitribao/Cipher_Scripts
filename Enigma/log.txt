+ Rotors.xls created: 2 rotors
+ Mirrors.xls created: 1 mirror
+ RotorBox.py created: 2 rotor-arrays
+ MirrorBox.py created: 1 mirror-array
+ Enigma.py created: rotor and mirror accessibility tested, lookup for position tested

+ findInput function created, tested. 
+ rotors modified: shifts instead of hard-coded position
+ mirrors remained unchanged
+ going down rotors is fine. mirror is fine
+ about to test going up rotors with findInput

+ File I/O tested. Input file was encoded succesfully. Output file, when encoded with same key, returned original file. 
+ 2 rotors used, shift = 0. Resulting text same as when tested without file IO.
